# letsbuild-youtube-clone

Let's Build is a new series on the Transloadit blog where we feature simple demo apps that leverage our file uploading & encoding platform, along with other cool tech to build simple versions of real world use cases. This repo holds the sample project code for building a YouTube Clone using Vue.js, Node.js, Firebase, Transloadit, Uppy.

## Running this app
This app runs on a Vue.js framework called Quasar. To get started, set up Quasar as explained in the docs [here](https://quasar-framework.org/guide/).

Next, change the URL to the API in the `src/router/routes.js` file where `window.base_url` was defined.

Finally, run the app

```
quasar dev
```
